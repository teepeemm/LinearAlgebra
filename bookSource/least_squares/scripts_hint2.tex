\hypertarget{scripts_least_squares_hint2}{For the first part}, what is the transpose of a $1 \times 1$ matrix? For the other two parts, note that $v \dotprod v = v^T v$. Can you express this in terms of $\norm{v}$? Also you need the trivial kernel only for the last part and just think about the null space of $M$. It might help to substitute $w = Mx$.
