\hypertarget{subspaces_and_spanning_sets_hint_2}{We want to check} whether 
\[
x-x^3 \in \text{span}\{x^2, 2x+x^2, x+ x^3 \}
\]
If you are wondering what it means to be in the span of these polynomials here is an example
\[
2(x^2) + 5(2x+x^2) \in \text{span}\{x^2, 2x+x^2, x+ x^3 \}
\]
Linear combinations where the polynomials are multiplied by scalars in $\mathbb{R}$ is fine. We are not allowed to multiply the polynomials together, since in a vector space there is not necessarily a notion of multiplication for two vectors.

Lets put this problem in the language of matrices. Since we can write $x^2 = 0 + 0x+1x^2 +0x^3$ we can write it as a column vector, where the coefficient of each of the terms is an entry.

\[
x^2 =\colvec{0\\0\\1\\0} \text{ , } 2x+x^2 =\colvec{0\\2\\1\\0} \text{ and }
x+x^3 =\colvec{0\\1\\0\\1}
 \]
Since we want to find out if $x-x^3 =\colvec{0\\1\\0\\-1}$ is in the span of these polynomials above we can ask, do there exist $r_1$, $r_2$ and $r_3$ such that 

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
0& 0& 0\\
0& 2& 1\\
1& 1& 0\\
0& 0& 1\\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
r_1\\
r_2\\
r_3\\
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
0\\
1\\
0\\
-1\\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
There are two ways to do this, one is by finding a $r_1$, $r_2$ and $r_3$ that work, another is to notice that there are no constant terms in any of the equations and to simplify the system so that it becomes
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
0& 2& 1\\
1& 1& 0\\
0& 0& 1\\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
r_1\\
r_2\\
r_3\\
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
1\\
0\\
-1\\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

From here you can determine if the now square matrix has an inverse. If the matrix has an inverse you can say that there are $r_1$, $r_2$ and $r_3$ that satisfy this equation, without actually finding them.
