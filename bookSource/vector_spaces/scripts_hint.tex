\hypertarget{scripts_vector_spaces_hint}{Lets worry about the} last part of \hyperref[problem_polynomials]{the problem}. The problem can be solved by considering a non-zero simple polynomial, such as a degree 0 polynomial, and multiplying by $i \in \mathbb{C}$. That is to say we take a vector $p \in P_3^{\Re}$ and then considering $i \cdot p$. This will violate one of the vector space rules about scalars, and you should take from this that the scalar field matters.

As a second hint, consider $\mathbb{Q}$ (the field of rational numbers). This is not a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ since $\sqrt{2} \cdot 1 = \sqrt{2} \notin \mathbb{Q}$, so it is not closed under scalar multiplication, but it is clearly a vector space over $\mathbb{Q}$.
