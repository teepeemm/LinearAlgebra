\hypertarget{scripts_inverse_matrix_unique_soln}{First}note  that (b) implies (a) is the easy direction: just think about what it means for $M$ to be non-singular and for a linear function to be well-defined. Therefore we assume that $M$ is singular which implies that there exists a non-zero vector $X_0$ such that $MX_0 = 0$. Now assume there exists some vector $X_V$ such that $M X_V = V$, and look at what happens to $X_V + c \cdot X_0$ for any $c$ in your field. Lastly don't forget to address what happens if $X_V$ does not exist.
