we find some important information, first that oranges always have twice as much sugar as apples, and second that the information about the barrel is recorded as $(s,f)$, where  $s =$ units of sugar in the barrel and $f = $ number of pieces of fruit in the barrel.
\\
We are asked to find a linear transformation relating this new representation to the one in the lecture, where in the lecture $x=$ the number of apples and $y=$ the number of oranges. This means we must create a system of equations relating the variable $x$ and $y$ to the variables $s$ and $f$ in matrix form. Your answer should be the matrix that transforms one set of variables into the other.

\emph{Hint:} Let $\lambda$ represent the amount of sugar in each apple.
\begin{enumerate}
\item To find the first equation  relate $f$ to the variables $x$ and~$y$.
\item To find the second equation, use the hint to figure out how much sugar is in $x$ apples, and $y$ oranges in terms of 
$\lambda$. Then write an equation for~$s$ using $x$, $y$ and $\lambda$.
\end{enumerate}
