%\item \label{prob_inversion_number} This problem is a ``hands-on'' look at why \hyperlink{permutation_parity}{the property} describing the parity of permutations is true.
%
%\hypertarget{inversion_number}{The \emph{inversion number}}\index{Permutation!Inversion number} of a permutation $\sigma$ is the number of pairs $i<j$ such that $\sigma(i)>\sigma(j)$; it's the number of ``numbers that appear left of smaller numbers'' in the permutation.  For example, for the permutation $\rho = [4,2,3,1]$, the inversion number is $5$. The number $4$ comes before $2,3,$ and $1$, and $2$ and $3$ both come before $1$.

\item \label{prob_determinant_trace} %(Extra Credit) 
Let $e^i_j$ denote the matrix with a 1 in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column and~0's everywhere else, and let $A$ be an arbitrary $2 \times 2$ matrix. Compute $\det(A + t I_2)$. What is the first order term (the $t^{1}$ term)? Can you express your results in terms of $\tr(A)$? What about the first order term in $\det(A + t I_n)$ for any arbitrary $n \times n$ matrix $A$ in terms of $\tr(A)$?

%(Extra Credit: 
(Directional) Derivative of the determinant:\\ 
Notice that $\det \colon\mathbb{M}_n^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ (where $\mathbb{M}_n^n$ is the vector space of all $n \times n$ matrices)  $\det$ is a function of $n^2$ variables so we can take directional derivatives of $\det$. 

Let $A$ be an arbitrary $n \times n$ matrix, and for all $i$ and $j$ compute the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \[
\lim_{t \rightarrow 0} \frac{\det(I_2 + t e^i_j) - \det(I_2)}{t}
\]

\item \[
\lim_{t \rightarrow 0} \frac{\det(I_3 + t e^i_j) - \det(I_3)}{t}
\]

\item \[
\lim_{t \rightarrow 0} \frac{\det(I_n + t e^i_j)  - \det(I_n)}{t}
\]

\item \[
\lim_{t \rightarrow 0} \frac{\det(I_n + A t) - \det(I_n)}{t}
\]
\end{enumerate}
Note, these  are the directional derivative in the $e^i_j$ and $A$ directions.
%Can you express your results in terms of the trace function?

\item How many functions are in the set $$\{ f:\{1,\dots,n\}\to \{1,\dots,n\} | f^{-1} {\rm ~exists} \}\, ?$$ What about the set $$\{1,\dots,n\}^{\{1,\dots,n\}}\, ?$$ Which of these two sets correspond to the set of all permutations of $n$ objects?

%\item \label{problem_permutation}\label{prob_inversion_number} Here we will examine some general properties of permutations and their applications. In particular, we will show that one way to compute the sign of a permutation is by finding the \hyperlink{inversion_number}{inversion number} $N$ of $\sigma$ and we have
%\[
%\sgn(\sigma) = (-1)^N.
%\]
%
%For this problem, let $\mu = [1,2,4,3]$.
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Show that every permutation $\sigma$ can be sorted by only taking simple (adjacent) transpositions\index{Permutation!Simple transposition} $s_i$ where $s_i$ interchanges the numbers in position $i$ and $i+1$ of a permutation $\sigma$ (in our other notation $s_i = \tau_{i,i+1}$). For example $s_2 \mu = [1, 4, 2, 3]$, and to sort $\mu$ we have $s_3 \mu = [1, 2, 3, 4]$.
%
%\item \label{prob_part_relations} We can compose simple transpositions together to represent a permutation (note that the sequence of compositions is not unique), and these are associative, we have an identity (the trivial permutation where the list is in order or we do nothing on our list), and we have an inverse since it is clear that $s_i s_i \sigma = \sigma$. Thus permutations of $[n]$ under composition are an example of a \hyperref[groups]{group}. However note that not all simple transpositions commute with each other since
%\begin{align*}
%s_1 s_2 [1, 2, 3] & = s_1 [1, 3, 2] = [3, 1, 2]
%\\ s_2 s_1 [1, 2, 3] & = s_2 [2, 1, 3] = [2, 3, 1]
%\end{align*}
%(you will prove here when simple transpositions commute). When we consider our initial permutation to be the trivial permutation $e = [1, 2, \dotsc, n]$, we do not write it; for example $s_i \equiv s_i e$ and $\mu = s_3 \equiv s_3 e$. This is analogous to not writing 1 when multiplying. Show that $s_i s_i = e$ (in shorthand $s_i^2 = e$), $s_{i+1} s_i s_{i+1} = s_i s_{i+1} s_i$ for all $i$, and $s_i$ and $s_j$ commute for all $|i - j| \geq 2$.
%
%\item Show that every way of expressing $\sigma$ can be obtained from using the relations proved in part~\ref{prob_part_relations}. In other words, show that for any expression $w$ of simple transpositions representing the trivial permutation $e$, using the proved relations.
%
%\emph{Hint: Use induction on $n$. For the induction step, follow the path of the $(n+1)$-th strand by looking at $s_n s_{n-1} \cdots s_k s_{k\pm1} \cdots s_n$ and argue why you can write this as a subexpression for any expression of $e$. Consider using diagrams of these paths to help.}
%
%\item The simple transpositions \hyperlink{action}{acts on} an $n$-dimensional vector space $V$ by $s_i v = E^i_{i+1} v$ (where $E^i_j$ is \hyperlink{elem_matrix_row_swap}{an elementary matrix}) for all vectors $v \in V$. Therefore we can just represent a permutation $\sigma$ as the matrix $M_{\sigma}$\footnote{Often people will just use $\sigma$ for the matrix when the context is clear.}, and we have $\det(M_{s_i}) = \det(E^i_{i+1}) = -1$. Thus prove that $\det(M_{\sigma}) = (-1)^N$ where $N$ is a number of simple transpositions needed to represent $\sigma$ as a permutation. You can assume that $M_{s_i s_j} = M_{s_i} M_{s_j}$ (it is not hard to prove) and that $\det(A B) = \det(A) \det(B)$. %\hyperref[detmultiplicative]{from Chapter~\ref*{elementarydeterminantsII}}.
%
%\emph{Hint: You to make sure $\det(M_{\sigma})$ is well-defined since there are infinite ways to represent $\sigma$ as simple transpositions.}
%
%\item Show that $s_{i+1} s_i s_{i+1} = \tau_{i, i+2}$, and so give one way of writing $\tau_{i, j}$ in terms of simple transpositions? Is $\tau_{i,j}$ an even or an odd permutation? What is $\det(M_{\tau_{i,j}})$? What is the inversion number of $\tau_{i,j}$?
%
%\item The minimal number of simple transpositions needed to express $\sigma$ is called the \emph{length}\index{Permutation!Length} of $\sigma$; for example the length of $\mu$ is 1 since $\mu = s_3$. Show that the length of $\sigma$ is equal to the inversion number of $\sigma$.
%
%\emph{Hint: Find an procedure which gives you a new permutation $\sigma^{\prime}$ where $\sigma = s_i \sigma^{\prime}$ for some $i$ and the inversion number for $\sigma^{\prime}$ is 1 less than the inversion number for $\sigma$.}
%
%\item Show that $(-1)^N = \sgn(\sigma) = \det(M_{\sigma})$, where $\sigma$ is a permutation with $N$ inversions. Note that this immediately implies that $\sgn(\sigma \rho) = \sgn(\sigma) \sgn(\rho)$ for any permutations $\sigma$ and $\rho$.
