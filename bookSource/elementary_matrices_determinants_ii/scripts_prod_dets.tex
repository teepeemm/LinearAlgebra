\hypertarget{scripts_elementary_matrices_determinants_ii_product}{Here we will prove more directly that} the determinant of a product of matrices is the product of their determinants. First we reference that for a matrix $M$ with rows $r_i$, if $M^{\prime}$ is the matrix with rows $r^{\prime}_j = r_j + \lambda r_i$ for $j \neq i$ and $r^{\prime}_i = r_i$, then $\det(M) = \det(M^{\prime})$ Essentially we have $M^{\prime}$ as $M$ multiplied by the elementary row sum matrices $S^i_j(\lambda)$. Hence we can create an upper-triangular matrix $U$ such that $\det(M) = \det(U)$ by first using the first row to set $m_i^1 \mapsto 0$ for all $i > 1$, then iteratively (increasing $k$ by 1 each time) for fixed $k$ using the $k$-th row to set $m_i^k \mapsto 0$ for all $i > k$.

Now note that for two upper-triangular matrices $U = (u_i^j)$ and $U^{\prime} = (u_i^{\prime j})$, by matrix multiplication we have $X = UU^{\prime} = (x_i^j)$ is upper-triangular and $x_i^i = u_i^i u_i^{\prime i}$. Also since every permutation would contain a lower diagonal entry (which is 0) have $\det(U) = \prod_i u_i^i$. Let $A$ and $A^{\prime}$ have corresponding upper-triangular matrices $U$ and $U^{\prime}$ respectively (i.e. $\det(A) = \det(U)$), we note that $AA^{\prime}$ has a corresponding upper-triangular matrix $UU^{\prime}$, and hence we have
\begin{align*}
\det(A A^{\prime}) & = \det(U U^{\prime}) = \prod_i u_i^i u_i^{\prime i}
\\ & = \left( \prod_i u_i^i \right) \left( \prod_i u_i^{\prime i} \right)
\\ & = \det(U) \det(U^{\prime}) = \det(A) \det(A^{\prime}).
\end{align*}
