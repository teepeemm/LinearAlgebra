\hypertarget{scripts_eigenvalseigenvects_jordan}{Consider the matrix}
\[
J_2 = \begin{pmatrix}
\lambda & 1
\\ 0 & \lambda
\end{pmatrix},
\]
and we note that we can just read off the eigenvector $e_1$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$. However the characteristic polynomial of $J_2$ is $P_{J_2}(\mu) = (\mu - \lambda)^2$ so the only possible eigenvalue is $\lambda$, but we claim it does not have a second eigenvector $v$. To see this, we require that
\begin{align*}
\lambda v^1 + v^2 & = \lambda v^1
\\ \lambda v^2 & = \lambda v^2
\end{align*}
which clearly implies that $v^2 = 0$. This is known as a Jordan $2$-cell\index{Jordan cell}, and in general, a Jordan $n$-cell with eigenvalue $\lambda$ is (similar to) the $n \times n$ matrix
\[
J_n = \begin{pmatrix}
\lambda & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & \lambda & 1 & \ddots & 0 \\
\vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & \cdots & 0 & \lambda & 1 \\
0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 & \lambda
\end{pmatrix}
\]
which has a single eigenvector $e_1$.

Now consider the following matrix
\[
M = \begin{pmatrix}
3 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 3 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
\]
and we see that $P_M(\lambda) = (\lambda - 3)^2(\lambda - 2)$. Therefore for $\lambda = 3$ we need to find the solutions to $(M - 3I_3)v = 0$ or in equation form:
\begin{align*}
v^2 & = 0
\\ v^3 & = 0
\\ -v^3 & = 0,
\end{align*}
and we immediately see that we must have $V = e_1$. Next for $\lambda = 2$, we need to solve $(M - 2I_3)v = 0$ or 
\begin{align*}
v^1 + v^2 & = 0
\\ v^2 + v^3 & = 0
\\ 0 & = 0,
\end{align*}
and thus we choose $v^1 = 1$, which implies $v^2 = -1$ and $v^3 = 1$. Hence this is the only other eigenvector for $M$.
