\item Maximize $f(x,y)=2x+3y$ subject to the constraints
$$
x\geq0\, ,\quad y\geq0\, ,\quad x+2y\leq2\, ,\quad 2x+y\leq2\, ,
$$
by 
\begin{enumerate}
\item sketching the region in the $xy$-plane defined by the constraints and then checking the values of $f$ at its corners; and,
\item the simplex algorithm ({\it hint:} introduce slack variables).
\end{enumerate}

Conoil operates two wells (well A and well B) in southern Grease (a small Mediterranean country). You have been employed to figure out how many barrels of oil they should pump from each well to maximize their profit (all of which goes to shareholders, not operating costs). The quality of oil from well A is better than from well B, so is worth 50\% more per barrel. The Greasy government cares about the environment and will not allow Conoil to pump in total more than 6 million barrels per year. Well A costs twice as much as well B to operate. Conoil's yearly operating budget is only sufficient to pump at most 10 million barrels from well B per year.Using both a graphical method and then (as a double check)  Dantzig's algorithm, determine how many barrels Conoil should pump from each well to maximize their profits.
