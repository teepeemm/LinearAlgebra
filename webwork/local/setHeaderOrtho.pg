The primary purpose of WeBWorK is to let you know that you are getting the correct answer or to alert you if you are making some kind of mistake. Usually you can attempt a problem as many times as you want before the due date. If you are having trouble figuring out your error, 
consult the book, or ask a fellow student, one of the TAs, or your professor for help.  Don't spend a lot of time guessing -- it's not very efficient or effective.
$PAR
Give 4 or 5  significant digits for (floating point) numerical answers.
For most problems you can 
enter elementary expressions such as 
$PAR
\( 2\wedge3 \) instead of 8, 
$PAR
\( sin(3*pi/2) \)instead of -1, 
$PAR
\( e\wedge (ln(2)) \) instead of 2, 
$PAR
\( (2+tan(3))*(4-sin(5))\wedge6-7/8 \) instead of 27620.3413, etc.
$PAR
